If you wish to try Julia related topics for the github project, here are the details.

- Apart from the MSc Maths Modelling Students. you are not compelled to do a project with Julia.
- Maths Modelling Students must attempt one. 
- I will do a few live demonstrations, outside of hours, in room C2062.

### 1. Grading Scheme
- 10% Open source computation is broken down as follows
..- 2.5% for using Github
..- 7.5% for three grading units (i.e. three mini-projects, such as Julia Notebooks) 
..- (I amended this breakdown slightly, since I announced it in class in Week 1)

### 2. Setting up an account.
- Use your github account to set up an account on JuliaBox.com.
- Set up a new notebook (see top right corner)
- Use Julia version 0.6.2.

### 3. Objective
- Write a little lesson plan / demonstration for something to do with Julia. 
- Choose something simple (i.e. matrices, set theory, For Loops). 
- One topic per grading unit. If some one picks a topic, no one else can pick it.
- We can discuss the topics on an ongoing basis. 

### 4. Documenting your code
- Remember to include markdown - providing a description of what you are doing.
  (Literate Programming: The code is the documentation and the code itself).
- There should be primary author per notebook, but you may edit someone else's notebook (fix typo's etc).
- Collaboration is encouraged. 

### 5. Researching your topics
- Try out the following websites for topics
 - Analytics Vidhya -  https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/resources-learn-julia/
 - Learning Julia - The Julia Language : https://julialang.org/learning/
 - Learn Julia - Best Julia Tutorials | Hackr.io : https://hackr.io/tutorials/learn-julia
- I don't mid you pinching code off the internet. Just make sure it works, and explain it relatively well.

### 6. Submission
- I will give a live demonstration of this in the C2062 Room, outside of class hours.
- I will add you to the Julia workshop repository page.
- You should be able to download the notebooks from Juliabox, and then upload it to github.
- You should be able to reload the contents of the Github repository to your JuliaBox account.
 
### 7. Afterwards
- You will be added to the contributors page on the repository.
- This is the type of thing you can talk about at a job interview, that you worked collaboratively on an open source tech project.
